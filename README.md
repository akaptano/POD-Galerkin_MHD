# POD-Galerkin_MHD
This codes calculates the dimensionalized POD and uses SINDy from the PySINDy python package to build a data-driven model for it. The code is used for NIMROD simulations of the HIT-SI experiment and this recent paper on data-driven reduced-order modeling for plasmas: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10389. The code relies on the PySINDy package.
